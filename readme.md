## My process

### Built with

- React
- TailwindCSS
- Vite

### What I learned

My main goal tackling this challenge was to try TailwindCSS and working with utility classes. In my day to day job, I usually work with either styled-components or SASS and BEM convention, and I'm not really proud of either of those... Tailwind uses a drastically different approach, which I was very skeptical of, and I thought I should try.

I also decided to try to use Vite instead of Webpack, just because it has gotten a lot of attention lately.

To my surprise, I really liked working with Tailwind and it's utility classes. Even without being familiar with all the terminology and class names, I think I solved the challenge quicker with Tailwind than I would have with regular CSS (which I'm familiar with)... and that's amazing.
